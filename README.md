This is a bootstrap project.

## Comments

This was me playing around with an animation library, to see how useful it would be. It's fine, for what it does.

## Ideas for Improvement

I think it would be nice to outfit this with a Formspree form, so that you would then have a minimalist all-in-one event website solution. 

You can see I started on this as I have a component by that name, but it doesn't render to the screen - probably some interference from the animation library. So it's there if you want to build on it.
