This is a bootstrap project.

## Comments

This was me playing around with an animation library, to see how useful it would be. It's fine, for what it does.

## Ideas for Improvement

I think it would be nice to outfit this with a Formspree form, so that you would then have a minimalist all-in-one event website solution. 

You can see I started on this in an earlier commit where I have a component by that name, but it doesn't render to the screen - probably some interference from the animation library. 

Since I only wanted to have the working part, I've removed it, but you could always add it back and try to get it work.
